Although you know it isn’t right, you try to listen in on the conversation he’s having---let’s call it your scientific interest.\n",

People from around the world go to my company’s website and fill-out a form about their U.F.O. experience. I would like to hire you to tell me where I should go if I want to see an U.F.O. or interview people that claim sightings. <br> </font>\n",
