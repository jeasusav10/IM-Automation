The next repository includes two exercises where data science abilities were used to solve the problems. 


## X-files Problem
The X-files is a problem used for practicing the abilities in data loading, cleaning and descriptive analysis. 
It was based on a dataset of UFO apperance of all around the world, and the goal of the problem was to identify a ranking of the places where UFOs have apperared with more frequency.

The results were presented on the code, however, the summary is the following. 
Based on the information above, the top 10 locations where it is more probable to find UFO appearances are:
- Seattle
- Hoboken
- Phoenix
- Winchester
- Los Angeles (East)
- Porland
- Coronado
- Glendale
- Houston 
- Conway

All of them are inside USA, in case it is desired to travel abroad, the top ten cities are:
- Spittafields (CAN)
- Toronto (CAN)
- Vancouver (CAN)
- Ottawa (CAN)
- Cornwall (UK)
- Juárez (MX)
- Syndey (AUS)
- Calgary (CAN)
- Winnipeg (CAN)
- Montréal (CAN)


## Diamonds Problem
The Diamonds is problem is for showing modeling abilities.
It was based on a datased of diamods an the goal was to predict the values of some 'stolen items'.

The results were presented on the code, however, the summary is the following.
